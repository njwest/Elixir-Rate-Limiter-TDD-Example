# RateLimiter

This repo is a companion to the [Test-driven Development in Elixir: Building a Rate Limiter with ExRated, ExUnit, and Doctests]() 
guide by Nick West.

Within, you will find an example rate limiter written in Elixir 
with [ExRated](), unit tests, and doc tests.

## Up and Running

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Run tests with `mix test`

<!-- ## Package Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `rate_limiter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rate_limiter, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/rate_limiter>.
