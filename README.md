# RateLimiter

This repo is a companion to the [Test-driven Development in Elixir: Building a Rate Limiter with ExRated, ExUnit, andÂ Doctests](https://njwest.medium.com/test-driven-development-in-elixir-building-a-rate-limiter-with-exrated-exunit-and-doctests-5c3f1e8c80fc) 
guide by Nick West.

Within, you will find an example rate limiter written in Elixir 
with [ExRated](https://github.com/grempe/ex_rated), unit tests, and doctests.

## Up and Running

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Run tests with `mix test`
